VRWorld Toolkit is an Unity Editor extension made to make making worlds for VRChat easier and overall lower the entry-level to make a good performing world. Currently the tool is aimed only for people making VRChat worlds but I'm considering making so it can be used even for standalone game development.

### Current features

1. World Debugger

Goes over trough your scene and checks for common issues and makes suggestions what to improve. Includes over 50 different tips, warning, errors and messages currently!

2. Disable On Build

Adds a Tag you can assign to GameObjects you want to disable when the world is uploaded. Biggest use case is using this for trigger based occlusion.

3. Post Processing setup

Automatically import and setup Post Processing

**Disclaimer:** This extension is still a work in progress. Even though I try to test it thoroughly things can break. *Remember to make backups of your projects and use this at your own risk!*
